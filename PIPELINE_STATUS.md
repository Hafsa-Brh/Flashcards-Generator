# 📋 Text Processing Pipeline - Status Report

## ✅ Successfully Restored and Tested

The text processing pipeline has been fully restored and tested successfully after the accidental undo. Here's what we have working:

### 🔧 Components Implemented

1. **Document Loader** (`src/flashcards/ingest/loader.py`)
   - ✅ Multi-format support: PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, HTML
   - ✅ MIME type and extension detection
   - ✅ Comprehensive error handling
   - ✅ Batch loading capabilities
   - ✅ Directory scanning with pattern matching

2. **Text Cleaner** (`src/flashcards/preprocess/cleaner.py`)
   - ✅ URL and email removal
   - ✅ Page artifact detection
   - ✅ Special character normalization
   - ✅ Whitespace cleanup
   - ✅ Aggressive cleaning mode
   - ✅ Detailed cleaning statistics

3. **Text Chunker** (`src/flashcards/preprocess/chunker.py`)
   - ✅ Multiple chunking strategies (paragraph, sentence, word)
   - ✅ Token counting with tiktoken
   - ✅ Intelligent boundary detection
   - ✅ Configurable overlap between chunks
   - ✅ Proper chunk metadata tracking

### 📊 Test Results

**Test Document**: `test_document.md` (1,522 characters, 217 words)

**Processing Results**:
- ✅ Document loaded: Markdown format detected correctly
- ✅ Text cleaned: 0% reduction (clean input), no URLs/emails/artifacts found
- ✅ Text chunked: 2 chunks created
  - Chunk 1: 439 chars, 73 tokens
  - Chunk 2: 1,430 chars, 270 tokens
  - Average size: 934 characters per chunk

**File Format Support**: 
- ✅ Markdown (.md): Multiple files tested successfully
- ✅ Framework ready for PDF, DOCX, TXT, HTML

### 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

1. **Modular Design**: Each component is independent and testable
2. **Configuration-Driven**: Settings controlled via config system
3. **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
4. **Extensible**: Easy to add new file formats and processing rules
5. **Performance Aware**: Token counting and chunk size optimization

### 📦 Dependencies Installed

All required packages are now properly installed in the virtual environment:
- ✅ `tiktoken` - Token counting for LLM optimization
- ✅ `pypdf` - PDF text extraction
- ✅ `python-docx` - DOCX document processing
- ✅ `beautifulsoup4` - HTML parsing
- ✅ `markdown` - Markdown to text conversion

### 🎯 Next Steps

The text processing pipeline is ready for integration with:

1. **LLM Generation Module** - Feed cleaned chunks to LM Studio for flashcard generation
2. **Validation System** - Quality check generated flashcards
3. **Export Functionality** - JSON output and future Anki integration
4. **CLI Interface** - User-friendly command-line tool

### 🧪 Testing Framework

The test script (`test_pipeline.py`) provides comprehensive validation of the entire pipeline and can be used for regression testing as we continue development.
