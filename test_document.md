## Python Basics

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built-in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development.

### Variables and Data Types

In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to them. Python has several built-in data types:

- **Integers**: Whole numbers like 5, -3, 100
- **Floats**: Decimal numbers like 3.14, -2.5, 0.0
- **Strings**: Text data enclosed in quotes like "Hello" or 'World'
- **Booleans**: True or False values

### Control Structures

Python provides several control structures for program flow:

#### If Statements
```python
if condition:
    # code block
elif another_condition:
    # code block
else:
    # code block
```

#### Loops
Python has two main types of loops:
- **For loops**: Used to iterate over sequences
- **While loops**: Execute while a condition is true

### Functions

Functions in Python are defined using the `def` keyword:

```python
def function_name(parameters):
    """Docstring explaining the function"""
    # function body
    return value
```

### Object-Oriented Programming

Python supports object-oriented programming with classes:

```python
class ClassName:
    def __init__(self, parameters):
        self.attribute = value
    
    def method_name(self):
        # method body
        pass
```

## Conclusion

This document covers the fundamental concepts of Python programming. Understanding these basics is essential for building more complex applications.
