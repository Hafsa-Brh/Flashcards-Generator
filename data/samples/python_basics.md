## Python Programming

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

### Key Features

- **Easy to learn**: Python has a simple syntax that mimics natural language.
- **Interpreted**: Python code is executed line by line, making debugging easier.
- **Object-oriented**: Python supports object-oriented programming paradigms.
- **Large standard library**: Python comes with many built-in modules and functions.

### Data Types

Python has several built-in data types:

1. **Integers**: Whole numbers like 1, 2, 3
2. **Strings**: Text data enclosed in quotes
3. **Lists**: Ordered collections of items
4. **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs for data storage

### Functions

Functions in Python are defined using the `def` keyword. They help organize code into reusable blocks.

Example:
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

This sample text contains enough information to generate several flashcards about Python programming basics.
